<p>Meester was born in Fort Worth, Texas, to Douglas Jay Meester and Constance Lynn (née Haas).[2][3] Her father is a real estate broker; her mother is a writer.[4] She has two brothers: an older brother, Douglas Logan Meester (born 1983), and a younger brother, Alexander "Lex" Meester (born 1994). At the time of her birth, Meester's parents were serving time in a federal prison for their involvement in a drug ring that smuggled marijuana from Jamaica to the United States.[5] Constance was able to give birth to Leighton in a hospital and nurse her for three months in a halfway house, before returning to prison to complete her sentence.[2][3] Her paternal grandparents cared for Meester during this period. She has maintained that her parents gave her a normal upbringing and, despite their criminal past, has stated, "It made me realize that you can't judge anyone—especially your parents—for what they've done in their past, because people change."[6] She grew up in Marco Island, Florida, where she participated in productions at a local playhouse.[7] Her parents separated in 1992.[8]
